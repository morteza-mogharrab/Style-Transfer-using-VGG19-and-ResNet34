# Style-Transfer-using-VGG19-and-ResNet34
This repository contains implementations of style transfer using two different deep-learning architectures: VGG19 and ResNet34. Style transfer is a technique in which the style of one image is applied to the content of another image, resulting in a new image that combines the style of one with the content of the other.
